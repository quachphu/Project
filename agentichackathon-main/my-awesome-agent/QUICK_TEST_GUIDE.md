## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If playground won't open:**

```bash
# Kill any existing process
lsof -ti:8501 | xargs kill

# Restart
cd /Users/parichaypothepalli/Downloads/agent-starter-pack/my-awesome-agent
make playground
```

### **If you see errors:**

1. Wait 10 seconds for the agent to fully load
2. Make sure you selected the "app" folder
3. Try refreshing the browser page

### **If port 8501 is busy:**

```bash

uv run adk web . --port 8502 --reload_agents
```
Then open: http://localhost:8502
