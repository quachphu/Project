# Current Progress & Next Steps

## âœ… Completed
1. Added raw data toggles for weather alert in frontend
2. Updated river gauge sensors to include `severity_score` (0-5) field
3. Added concise instruction to AI orchestrator agent
4. Added "fetching gauges" progress message with 2-sec delay

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- Adding raw data toggles for river gauges and ML results in frontend

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- [x] Add severity_score to all 6 sensors
- [ ] Add "Checking with orchestrator agent" message before detailed query
- [ ] Add "Querying sensor data for TÂ±30 mins" message
- [ ] Display severity scores in frontend sensor table

### Phase 3 Enhancements  
- [ ] Add "Triggering XGBoost model" event
- [ ] Add "Model evaluation results" event with metrics

### Phase 4: Social Media Analysis (NEW)
- [ ] Create `social_media_agent.py` with tools:
  - `search_x_posts(keywords, region, zipcode)` 
  - `summarize_posts(posts_data)`
  - `identify_affected_zones(summary, sensor_data)`
- [ ] Create `mock_data/x_posts.py` for dummy Twitter/X posts
- [ ] Add Phase 4 scoring (0-10 points) to orchestrator
- [ ] Update backend to trigger social media analysis after Phase 3
- [ ] Update frontend to display:
  - X post search progress
  - Top posts summary
  - Affected zones (A, B, C with risk levels)
  - Social media score

### Scoring System Update
- Weather Alert: 0-25 points
- River Gauges: 0-20 points  
- ML Similarity: 0-10 points
- **Social Media: 0-10 points (NEW)**
- **Total: 0-65 points**

## Next Command
Run frontend and test current changes, then proceed with Phase 4 implementation.
